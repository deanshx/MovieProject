 Once upon a time there was a lovely princess  But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort  which could only be broken by loves first kiss  She was locked away in a castle  guarded by a terrible firebreathing dragon  Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison  but none prevailed  She waited in the dragons keep  in the highest room of the tallest tower  for her true love and true loves first kiss   Like thats ever gonna happen     What a load of  Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me  I am not the sharpest tool in the shed  She was looking

so Farquaad will give you back a swamp  which you only dont have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place   Is that about right  Maybe theres a good reason donkeys shouldnt talk  I dont get it Why dont you just pull some of that ogre stuff on him  Throttle him lay siege to his fortress  grind his bones to make your bread the whole ogre trip  Oh I know what  Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village  and put their heads on a pike  gotten a knife cut open their spleen and drink their fluids  Does that sound good to you  Uh no not really no  For your information theres a lot more to ogres than people think   Example  Example   Okay um ogres are like onions   They stink   Yes No  They make you cry  No  You leave them out in the sun they get all brown start sprouting little white hairs  No Layers  Onions have layers  Ogres have layers Onions have layers  You get it We both have layers   Oh you both have layers Oh   You know not everybody likes onions  Cake Everybody loves cakes Cakes have layers  I dont care what everyone likes  Ogres are not like cakes  You know what else everybody likes Parfaits  Have you ever met a person you say Lets get some parfait  they say No I dont like no parfait   Parfaits are delicious  No  You dense irritating miniature beast of burden  Ogres are like onions End of story  Byebye See ya later  Parfaits may be the

lake of lava  Come on Donkey Im right here beside ya okay  For emotional support  well just tackle this thing together one little baby step at a time   Really  Really really   Okay that makes me feel so much better Just keep moving   And dont look down  Okay dont look down Dont look down  Dont look down Keep on moving Dont look down   Shrek Im looking down  Oh God I cant do this Just let me off

with being afraid  Fears a sensible response to an unfamiliar situation  Unfamiliar dangerous situation I might add  With a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and breathes fire  it sure doesnt mean youre a coward if youre a little scared  I sure as heck am not a coward I know that   Donkey two things okay  Shut up  Now go over there and see if you can find any stairs  Stairs I thought we

Now come on    But this isnt right  You were meant to charge in sword drawn banner flying  Thats what all the other knights did  Yeah right before they burst into flame  Thats not the point Oh  Wait Where are you going The exits over there  Well I have to save my ass  What kind of knight are you  One of a kind   Slowdown Slowdown baby please  I believe its healthy to get to know someone over a long period of time  Just call me oldfashioned   I dont want to rush into a physical relationship  Im not emotionally ready for a commitment of uh this  Magnitude really is the word Im looking for  Magnitude Hey that is unwanted physical contact  Hey what are you doing  Okay okay Lets just backup a little and take this one step a ta time  We really should get to know each other first as friends or pen pals  Im on theroada lot but I just love receiving cards  Id really love to stay but  Dont do that Thats my tail Thats my personal tail  Youre gonna tear it off I dont give permission What are you gonna do with that  Hey now No way No No  No no No No no no No Oh            Hi Princess  It talks  Yeah its getting him to shut up thats the trick      Oh                 Okay you two head for the exit  Ill take care of the dragon   Run                        You did it  You rescued me Youre amazing Youre  Youre wonderful Youre  a little unorthodox Ill admit  But thy deed is great and thine heart is pure   I am eternally in your debt    And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed  I hope you heard that She called me a noble steed She think Im a steed   The battle is won  You may remove your helmet good Sir Knight   Uh no  Why not  I have helmet hair  Please I wouldst look upon the face of my rescuer  No no you wouldnt st  But how will you kiss me  What That wasnt in the job description  Maybe its a perk  No its destiny Oh you must know how it goes  A princess locked in a tower and beset by a dragon  is rescued by a brave knight  and then they share true loves
