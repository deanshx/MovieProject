exits over there Well I have to save my ass What kind of knight are you One of a kind Slowdown Slowdown baby please I believe its healthy to get to know someone over a long period of time Just call me oldfashioned I dont want to rush into a physical relationship Im not emotionally ready for a commitment of uh this Magnitude really is the word Im looking for Magnitude Hey that is unwanted physical contact Hey what are you doing Okay okay Lets just backup a little and take this one step a ta time We really should get to know each other first as friends or pen pals Im on theroada lot but I just

rescuer No no you wouldnt st But how will you kiss me What That wasnt in the job description Maybe its a perk No its destiny Oh you must know how it goes A princess locked in a tower and beset by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight and then they share true loves first kiss Hmm With Shrek You think Wait Wait You think that Shrek is your true love Well yes You think Shrek is your true love What
