favor as a token of my gratitude  Thanks You didnt slay the dragon  Its on my todo list Now come on  But this isnt right You were meant to charge in sword drawn banner flying Thats what all the other knights did  Yeah right before they burst into flame  Thats not the point Oh Wait Where are you going The exits over there Well I have to save my ass What kind of knight are you One of a kind Slow down Slow down baby please I believe its healthy to get to know someone over a long period of time Just call me oldfashioned I dont want to rush into a physical relationship Im not emotionally ready for a commitment of uh this Magnitude really is the word Im looking for Magnitude Hey that is unwanted physical contact Hey what are you doing Okay okay Lets just back up a little and take this one step at a time We really should get to know each other first as friends or pen pals Im on the road a lot but I just love receiving cards Id really love to stay but Dont do that Thats my tail Thats my personal tail Youre gonna tear it off I dont give permission What are you gonna do with that Hey now No way No No No no No No no no No Oh Hi Princess It talks Yeah its getting him to shut up thats the trick Oh Okay you two heard for the exit Ill take care of the dragon Run You did it You rescued me Youre amazing  Youre Youre wonderful Youre a little unorthodox Ill admit But thy deed is great and thy heart is pure I am eternally in your debt And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed  I hope you heard that She called me a noble steed She think Im a steed  The battle is won You may remove your helmet good Sir Knight Uh no Why not I have helmet hair Please I wouldst look upon the face of my rescuer No no you wouldnt st But how will you kiss me What That wasnt in the job
